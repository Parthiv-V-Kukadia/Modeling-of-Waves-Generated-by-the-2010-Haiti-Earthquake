# Modeling of Waves Generated by the 2010 Haiti Earthquake

This project details the numerical modeling of a 2D harmonic wave, approximating the wave propagation following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. A second-order central finite difference method was implemented to simulate the wave, with real-world ground station data from the earthquake used to inform the model's boundary conditions. The simulated wave is then compared against the data to assess the accuracy of the approximation.

## Code Description

The MATLAB code simulates the 2D wave equation and compares an approximate numerical solution with an "exact" solution derived using real-world amplitude data from the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.

The core steps of the code are:

1.  **Problem Definition:** Sets up the 2D wave equation ($u_{tt} = c^{2} (u_{xx} + u_{yy})$) along with its initial and boundary conditions (homogeneous Dirichlet boundaries).

2.  **Data Loading:** Reads amplitude data from an Excel file (`haiti_ground_station_data.xlsx`), presumably containing measurements related to the earthquake's impact.

3.  **Parameter Initialization:**
    * Defines parameters for the "exact" harmonic wave, including frequency ($f$), velocity ($v$), angular frequency ($\omega$), and phase ($\phi$). These are based on estimations related to the earthquake.
    * Sets parameters for the numerical approximation using the finite difference method, including wave speed ($c$), Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) condition value ($C_{cfl}$), spatial step sizes ($dx$, $dy$), a stability parameter ($h$), and the time step size ($dt$) derived from the CFL condition.
    * Creates the time ($t$), x ($x$), and y ($y$) meshes for the simulation.
    * Initializes 3D arrays to store the approximate solution (`u_app`) and the "exact" solution (`u_ex`) over space and time.

4.  **"Exact" Amplitude Extraction:** Extracts amplitude values from the loaded data to match the time steps of the simulation, assuming the data corresponds to the wave's amplitude over time.

5.  **"Exact" and Initial Condition Setup:** Initializes the first time step of both the approximate and "exact" solutions using a formula that incorporates the loaded amplitude data and the defined wave parameters. Boundary conditions for the "exact" solution are also set for the initial time steps.

6.  **Numerical Approximation:** Implements the second-order central finite difference scheme to iteratively compute the approximate solution (`u_app`) at each time step based on the values at previous time steps and neighboring spatial points. The formula used is:
    ```
    u_{app}(i, j, k+1) = (h^2)(u_{app}(i+1,j,k) - 2u_{app}(i,j,k) + u_{app}(i-1,j,k)) + (C_{cfl}^2)(u_{app}(i,j+1,k) - 2u_{app}(i,j,k) + u_{app}(i,j-1,k)) + 2u_{app}(i,j,k) - u_{app}(i,j,k-1)
    ```

7.  **Error Calculation:** Computes the absolute difference (`e_sol`) between the scaled approximate solution (`u_app/60`) and the "exact" solution (`u_ex`) at each time step. The maximum error (`max_e_sol`) is also determined.

8.  **Wave Plot Simulation:** Generates a dynamic 3D plot showing the "exact" wave, the numerically approximated wave (scaled), and the error between them as a function of x, y, and time. The plots are updated at each time step, creating an animation.

9.  **Snapshot Plots:** Creates several static figures showing the "exact" wave and the approximate wave at specific time instances.

10. **Error Profile Plots:** Generates plots showing the error along a specific y-coordinate as a function of x at particular time instances.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2.  **Data File:** Make sure the Excel file `haiti_ground_station_data.xlsx` is located in the same directory as the MATLAB script. This file should contain the time and amplitude data used for the "exact" solution and boundary conditions. The script specifically reads data from column 'G' for time and column 'K' for amplitude.
3.  **Run the Script:** Open the MATLAB script in the MATLAB environment and run it. The script will execute the simulation and generate the animated and static plots.

The generated plots will visualize the "exact" wave based on the provided data, the wave approximated using the finite difference method, and the error between these two, providing insights into the accuracy of the numerical model in representing the wave propagation following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.
