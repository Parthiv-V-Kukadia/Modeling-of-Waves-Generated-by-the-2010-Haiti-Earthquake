# Modeling-of-Waves-Generated-by-the-2010-Haiti-Earthquake
This project describes the modeling process of a 2D harmonic wave using a second order finite difference method. The author was able to use real world data from the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to set boundary conditions for the model and obtain an approximate solution. The approximate solution was compared to the real world data.
